Hardware:
Arduino pro - pro mini
atmega 328 16mhz

Pinout board:

VCC
RXD
TXD
GND
DTR

The first version of the board requires a small fix inline in the flash board
dtr(ftdi) -> 100nf (.1uf) ceramic -> dtr (board)

If everything else fails:
 - Re-flash the arduino bootloader to the atmega chip using a stk500 or something.
 - Depending on your atmega 328 (328/328p) you may need to switch the last byte of the m328p so it ends up with 0x14
   (locate arvdude_bin in arduino install path and set it in avrdude.conf next to it)
